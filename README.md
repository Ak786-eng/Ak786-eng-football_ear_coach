# Football Ear Coach (Offline)

An offline football training **ear-coach** app that calls out randomized commands in your ear: *Shoot, Dribble, Man on, Turn, Sprint, Cross,* etc. Works entirely **offline** using your device's Text-to-Speech (TTS) once an offline voice is installed.

## Features
- Randomized commands with adjustable min/max gap (e.g., 3â€“6 seconds)
- Choose categories: Ball Control, Passing, Shooting, Defensive, Physical
- **Combo** commands (e.g., "Dribble then Shoot")
- Vibration cue before each command (optional)
- Add your **own custom commands**
- Saves your preferences locally
- One-tap start/stop, fully hands-free with earphones

## 100% Offline
This app uses Android's built-in **offline TTS** if you install a voice:
- Go to **Settings â†’ System â†’ Languages & input â†’ Text-to-speech** (varies by device)
- Install a language pack (English/Hindi/Urdu supported on many devices)
- Select the **Download** option for offline use

> If you prefer recorded human voices instead of TTS, you can later replace TTS with bundled audio files.
